I am very passionate about this project and am always looking to make new friends whom I can program with.

The project is developed in ASP.NET MVC 3 using C#. If you know how to program with these technologies, please email me :)

You are welcome to apply for the project even if you only know C# and not MVC. I am always willing to teach what I know about MVC because it's fun!

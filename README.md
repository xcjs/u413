U413
====

This is the code for the once "famous" U413.com community. Alex Ford started 
[the original community](https://github.com/chevex/StartOfTheInternet) in 2010 
and the project was written in C#. The project was later taken over by some 
friends who wrote [their own version](https://github.com/ConsciousCode/u413) in 
python. 

This version is the original .NET version exported from Google Code.
